/**
 * Task
 * You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.
 * Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning
 * and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).
 */
/**
 * Approach 3: Single Pass Approach
 * Intuition
 * The problem can be solved in two iteration through the list:
 * by iterating till the end of the list and finding listLength and finding kth Node on the way;
 * by iterating until listLength -k
 *
 * For solution with one iteration
 * The trick is:
 * If endNode is k positions behind a certain node currentNode,
 * when currentNode reaches the end of linked list i.e at n-th node,
 * the endNode would be at the nâˆ’kth node.
 *
 * A similar trick is used in a few other Linked List problems like Remove Nth Node From the End of List and
 * the Fast and Slow Pointer Approach in Find The Middle Of Linked List.
